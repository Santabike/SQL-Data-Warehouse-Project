# SQL-Data-Warehouse-Project
In this project, I take a company's messy data and then clean it up, removing all empty spaces, standardising the data etc. 
This makes the data able to be used by data analysts.

Spesicically what the code does:
Step one: It takes the imported dirty 'bronze' CSV files into SQLite.
Step two: then it cleans the data and imports it into stage two, the 'silver' layer.
